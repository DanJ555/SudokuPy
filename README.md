# SudokuPy
This is a simple script to solve sudoku puzzles I got the idea bored out of my mind at warfighter. Sites that randomly generate puzzles have 4 catagories: easy, normal, hard,
really hard. While doing a puzzle I thought about the algorithm I was doing to solve them and how it failed with the hardest tier. I then wrote this script to prove to myself the
hardest tier really does need guessing to solve. As such, this script will easily solve tiers 1-3, but I haven't quiet gotten it to consistently solve 4. I think it still bugs out
with some puzzles. I want to come back to this when I have a proper row,column,&9x9 box objects, and not just lists inside lists containing the cell object, to see if I can
implement better guessing.
