# SudokuPy
Simple script to solve sudoku puzzles. One day I was doing them during some down time during military training and
realized it would be a great exercise in programming to convery the process of solving the harder puzzles into python
instructions.
I though a cell object that kept track of its siblings in each row, column, and box was the way to go, so it could easily let those other cells know a a value is taken. But that was hard to manage that and it was never able to work as well as a backtracking algorithm.
